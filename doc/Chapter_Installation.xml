ITAP requires GAP interface to singular <Cite Key="singulargap"/> which is another GAP package.
Nowadays, it comes bundled with GAP 4.7+. If your gap installation doesn't have this package
you can follow the instructions in <Cite Key="singulargap"/> to install it.
To get the newest version of ITAP, download the .zip archive from <URL>https://github.com/jayant91089/itap</URL>
and unpack it using
<Display>\texttt{unzip itap-x.zip}</Display>
Do this preferably inside the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Math>itap</Math>.
This completes the installation of the package. If you do not know the whereabouts of the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory, invoke the following in GAP:
<Listing Type="Code"><![CDATA[
GAPInfo.("RootPaths");
]]></Listing>

Look for pkg directory inside any of the paths returned.
One can then start using ITAP by invoking
<Display>gap></Display>
<Listing Type="Code"><![CDATA[
LoadPackage( "itap");
]]></Listing>

from within GAP. This would automatically load the GAP interface to singular, so you don't have to load it seperately.
