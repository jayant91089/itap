  [33X[0;0YITAP requires GAP interface to singular [CG12] which is another GAP package.
  Nowadays,  it  comes bundled with GAP 4.7+. If your gap installation doesn't
  have  this  package you can follow the instructions in [CG12] to install it.
  To  get  the  newest  version  of  ITAP,  download  the  .zip  archive  from
  [7Xhttps://github.com/jayant91089/itap[107X and unpack it using[133X

  [33X[0;0YDo  this  preferably inside the [23Xpkg[123X subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation.
  It  creates  a  subdirectory called [23Xitap[123X. This completes the installation of
  the  package.  If  you  do not know the whereabouts of the [23Xpkg[123X subdirectory,
